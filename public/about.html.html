<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Marc!</p>
<p>And I love extreme sports and good entertainment! I subscribe to the "work-hard/play-hard" philosophy. I believe life is an adventure (or at least, it can be and it takes no prisoners.) 
  Participate or get left behind (I say).</p>

<p>As a young boy, I discovered motocross racing at the young age of eight. I went to my first professional racing event at the Los Angeles Colliseum. I  was hooked ever since.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to receive a motocross  dirtbike at the age of thirteen with a very nearby location to ride. Although not legally permitted, I did enjoy the thrill of the action with a few friends.</p>
<p>It was not long though before it became a problem with local authorities that unless we had trucks and insurance to ride in appropriate riding parks, my bike just stood parked in the garage.</p>
<p>Eventually I sold it a few years later and used the proceeds to buy a high quality turntable, which marked the beginning of a new interest in D.J.ing during my high school years.</p>
<p>It wasn't until many years later that I got to pick up where I had left off in my riding passion. I was 29 and then able to afford going to more appropriate places with a few friends. I did enjoy it, but only for a very brief time.</p>
<p>Today, I am much older, but just as passionate about riding. Looking back I had taken many a fall, but those experiences have not been lost. I ride with caution now, but still with the thrill of momentary air-time and power-blasting out of a berm. It's always an exhilirating experience.</p>
<p>This is a special event in my sporadic riding passion. On my Birthday, I welcome all affictionado comradery to join me on a day-long riding spree.</p>
